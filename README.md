My Portfolio

https://glenhood.github.io/Glen-Hood-Portfolio/

I created a portfolio to provide work samples for potential employers. This site has the ability to navigate to my previous work once the portfoilio is loaded. The site also includes my name and a recent photo. Also, the site has provided links that guide the user to an "About Me", "Work", and linkable contact buttons. When this page is resized, it is resposive and adapts to the users viewpoint.
